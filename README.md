# Space-Invaders
The classic Space Invaders game written purely in Java.

This is my attempt at Space Invaders. This is one of my first attempts at a game, so this was more of a learning project to figure out game programming and the various aspects for it, such as displaying and moving mobs, game cycles, and collision detection.

This game has 6 levels, with each increasing level having more mobs. As more mobs are killed, they speed up making them harder to hit.

The left and right arrow keys move the "tank" and the spacebar is used to fire bullets, which up to 5 can be fired and visible on the screen at one time. Clicking on the screen allows you to pause the game, and you can resume by clicking the resume button.
